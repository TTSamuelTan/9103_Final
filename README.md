# **TimeWheel HandBook**

## Automatic animation(Timers)
When the webpage is opened, the circles in the image will automatically begin to rotate. This rotation undergoes a cyclical speed change: ***first accelerating for 60 seconds, then decelerating for another 60 seconds***, repeating this cycle continuously. 
## Interactive animation(Events)
when a circle is ***clicked***, a circle with a random color is generated at the same position.
